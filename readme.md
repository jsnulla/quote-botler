# Quote BOTLer

## What is this project for?
Nothing, really. It's literally an experiment I just wanted to try. I wanted to see how people would react when reading (hopefully) inspiring quotes on their Twitter feed at specific times of the day(7am, 3pm, and 8pm), and learning about the Twitter API, AWS Lamdba, and AWS CloudWatch Events at the same time.

## How do I need to implement this on my own Twitter account?
1) You need an AWS account - free tier should be fine.
2) Your own Twitter and Twitter developer accounts - I do not recommend publishing this Twitter app for mass use.
3) A development machine with Serverless Framework installed - and a bit of knowledge to use it.

## Notes
* Please do not use this to spam Twitter. You would need to apply for a Twitter developer account, so please adhere to their terms. I am not responsible for you by the way. There are rules, and there are consequences.
* Any amount that AWS charges you is not my fault, nor is it my concern.
* Thank you, https://favqs.com/api/qotd for providing such an API. Please contact me if there is anything concerning about my Twitter app.

## Lastly
Have fun, I guess. :)
